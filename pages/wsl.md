# Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
Developers can access the power of both Windows and Linux at the same time on a Windows machine. The **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** lets developers install a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Kali, Debian, Arch Linux, etc) and use Linux applications, utilities, and Bash command-line tools directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup.

## Install 

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator.
2. Run the command: 
   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```
3. Restart your computer if prompted.
4. Set up your Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu) by following the on-screen instructions.
